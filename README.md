# new_setup
Setting up new MacBook M3


### Few checks to see what it comes with

First check python version. Mine came with 3.9. 
```
which python3
which pip3
python --version
```

Next check which packages come installed.
```
pip list 
```

Next you should upgrade pip and python versions. Also you should setup alises.
